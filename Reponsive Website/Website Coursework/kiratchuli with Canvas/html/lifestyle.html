        <h2>Hindu foundation of the Kingdom of Nepal</h2>
            <p class="hindu">Historians and local traditions say that a Hindu sage named "Ne" established himself in the valley of Kathmandu during prehistoric times, and that the word "Nepal" means the place protected ("pala" in Sanskrit) by the sage Ne.[3] He performed religious ceremonies at Teku, the confluence of the Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers.[4] According to legend he selected a pious cowherd to be the first of the many kings of the Gopala Dynasty.[3] These rulers are said to have ruled Nepal for over 500 years.[5] He selected Bhuktaman to be the first king in the line of the Gopal (Cowherd) Dynasty.[4] The Silncan Gopal dynasty ruled for 621 years. Yakshya Gupta was the last king of this dynasty.

According to Skanda Purana, a rishi called "Ne" or "Nemuni" used to live in Himalaya.[6] In the Pashupati Purana, he is mentioned as a saint and a protector.[7] He is said to have practiced penance at the Bagmati and Kesavati rivers[8] and to have taught his doctrines there too.[3]</p>
